        <h1>10% of Profits go to destigmatizing mental illness</h1>
        <p>Mental health is a cause close to my heart. As someone who manages mental illness myself, I know the stigma can have a huge impact on our self-percetion, as well as our ability to get the help we need.</p>
        <p>I want to do more. I want mental illness not to be a topic swept under the rug but one we are able to have a real conversation about. I want a system for more accurate diagnosis. Being misdiagnosed, besides getting on the wrong medication (which can exacerbate other health issues), can impact your mindset, your healing and your ability to manage your condition. Since I'm not a scientist, I don't even know where to start to create a better system for diagnosis. This is what I can do: donate to those doing the work to help others.</p>
        <p>According to the World Health Organization, it is estimated one in four people in the world are affected by mental illness at some point in their lives (as of 2001).</p>
        <h2>“TREATMENTS ARE AVAILABLE, BUT NEARLY TWO-THIRDS OF PEOPLE WITH A KNOWN MENTAL DISORDER NEVER SEEK HELP FROM A HEALTH PROFESSIONAL. STIGMA, DISCRIMINATION AND NEGLECT PREVENT CARE AND TREATMENT FROM REACHING PEOPLE WITH MENTAL DISORDERS. WHERE THERE IS NEGLECT, THERE IS LITTLE OR NO UNDERSTANDING. WHERE THERE IS NO UNDERSTANDING, THERE IS NEGLECT.” </h2>
        <p>Estimates suggest that only half of people with mental illness receive treatment. In the US it’s only 41% according to the National Council for Behavioral Health.</p>
        <h2>-1 IN 5 U.S. ADULTS EXPERIENCE MENTAL ILLNESS EACH YEAR
            -1 IN 25 U.S. ADULTS EXPERIENCE SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS EACH YEAR
            -1 IN 6 U.S. YOUTH AGED 6-17 EXPERIENCE A MENTAL HEALTH DISORDER EACH YEAR
            -50% OF ALL LIFETIME MENTAL ILLNESS BEGINS BY AGE 14, AND 75% BY AGE 24
            -SUICIDE IS THE 2ND LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH AMONG PEOPLE AGED 10-34</h2>

        <h1>DESTIGMATIZING MENTAL ILLNESS COULD MAKE A HUGE IMPACT ON MORE PEOPLE GETTING THE HELP THEY NEED. </h1>
        <img src="https://www.co.marion.or.us/HLT/PH/PS/PublishingImages/Pages/Suicide-Prevention/NSPL_Logo.jpg" alt="Suicide Prevention Lifeline logo 988 https://988lifeline.org/" />
        <p>I chose the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline because they are able to make a direct impact on individuals that are suffering. They are a US based suicide prevention network of over 160 crisis centers that provide 24/7 confidential service via a toll-free hotline. It’s available to anyone in suicidal crisis or emotional distress and their loved ones. A caller receives immediate counseling and local mental health referrals. </p>
        <p>If we can listen to those who are suffering, we can better understand their needs and a better way to move forward. We need to further educate people on what mental illness truly is, so that those suffering can better understand what they are dealing with. </p>
        <p>And I want this business to support me and help others. So 10% of profits from each sale go to the <a href="https://988lifeline.org/">National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.</a></p>
