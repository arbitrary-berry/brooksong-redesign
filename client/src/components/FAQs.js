        <h2>FREE SHIPPING</h2>
        <p>Please allow 3+ weeks for production. You will be emailed tracking information once the product is made.</p>
        <p>Shipping is free via USPS. I am currently only shipping within the United States.</p>
        <p>The packaging supplier makes our boxes with as much recycled content as is humanly possible. Noissue, the tissue paper and sticker supplier, plants a tree every time brooksong design places an order. They print on acid-free paper with soy-based ink to keep chemicals out of their products. The packaging can be easily recycled or reused to continue our effort to be eco-conscious.</p>
        <p>Each item is wrapped in tissue paper because everyone loves getting a gift! (Even if you bought it for yourself) </p>
        <h2>WARRANTY</h2>
        <p>Any defects in craftsmanship - such as stitching coming undone or a rivet that no longer holds - will be repaired for free up to a year after purchase. You only pay for shipping.</p>
        <p>Damage incurred through ordinary wear and tear is not covered under the warranty but can be judged on a case-by-case basis and restored to usable condition at an hourly repair rate plus shipping.</p>
        <p>I do not repair items I didn't make.</p>
        <h2>RETURNS</h2>
        <p>I think you’ll love your brooksong design! However, if you’re not satisfied you can reach out to me via the contact page to start the return process.</p>
        <p>I accept returns of unused items in their original condition within 14 days of delivery. Please note: custom and personalized orders cannot be returned.</p>
        <p>A return shipping quote and label will be provided once your return has been accepted. The cost of return shipping will be considered your responsibility and deducted from your refund.</p>
        <p>In the unlikely event that your item arrives damaged or your order is inaccurate, a return shipping label will be provided and I will send you a replacement at no additional cost.</p>
