        <h1>THE LEATHER</h1>
        <p>The leather is purchased directly from an award-winning Italian tannery that sources hides from the beef industry. Ecologically friendly and sustainable business practices start with the leather supplier and run through the entire business.</p>
        <p>The hides are chrome-tanned, making them supple, resilient, and moderately durable, with a heat and stain resistant finish. Because leather is an organic material, you can expect its appearance to change subtly over time.</p>
        <p>I incorporate the raw edge of the leather hide into the designs, rather than discarding it. This creates a distinctive look and helps reduce environmental waste.</p>
        <h1>LEATHER CARE</h1>
        <p>If your leather gets wet, wipe off the moisture immediately and allow it to air-dry.</p>
        <p>If it gets dirty, wipe it clean with a soft, dry towel. For more stubborn stains, a damp cloth may be used. If that still doesnâ€™t do it, lather a bar of unscented soap and gently work it into the leather until you can see the stain begin to break up. Then wipe it clean with a damp cloth and allow the product to air-dry.</p>
        <p>NEVER use heat on your leather goods or place them in the sun to dry as this can cause shrinking and cracking. Avoid storing your leather goods in sunlight or damp places.</p>
        <p>Over the lifetime of the piece permanent stains are likely to occur but that just adds more character and individuality.</p>
        <p>Take care of the leather and it will bring you years of joy!</p>
        <h1>WARRANTY</h1>
        <p>Any defects in craftsmanship: stitching coming undone, a rivet that no longer holds, will be repaired for free up to a year after purchase. You only pay for shipping.</p>
        <p>Damage incurred through ordinary wear and tear is not covered under the warranty but can be judged on a case-by-case basis and restored to usable condition at an hourly repair rate plus shipping.</p>
        <p>I do not repair items I didn't make</p>
